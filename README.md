# Arduino_Mega_using_Embedded_C

This is a project done by me @Karthikh Amaran.
As a beginner in the field of embedded systems I was interested to learn about the registers of a Microcontroller.

Being a beginner I chose to start learn about register from ARDUINO_MEGA (ATMEL AVR based) MicroController.4
My learning from this project were,
1. What is a Datasheet of a Microcontroller.
2. What is the use of Register in a MCU.
3. How we use Datsheet and register to program the chip without using Abstractions.

**THE ENTIRE PROJECT WAS DONE ONLY USING EMBEDDED C WITHOUT USING ARDUINO IDE ABSTRACTION LANGUAGE**
**I did this project in WOKWI Online Simulator platform. So I Have attached the links for those projects in the WOKWI_LINKS.txt file**
